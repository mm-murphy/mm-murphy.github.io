## Sprouting in STEM

Sometimes scientists get a bad rep. It's not all old dudes in dorky ties, and it's not always an easy time. I co-host a podcast named "Sprouting in STEM" where we discuss the trials and tribulations of being a young person starting a career in science. We hope to help make science more accessible to everyone, dorky tie or not.
