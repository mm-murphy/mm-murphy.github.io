# About Me

![](images/me_christmastree.jpeg)






Hi! I am Matthew, an astronomy graduate student and PhD candidate at Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona.

If you want to **contact me**, feel free to email me at mmmurphy@arizona.edu

I study exoplanets and their atmospheres through a variety of observational techniques. I'm interested in the composition and dynamics of exoplanet atmospheres, and building maps of the global properties of the atmosphere using the James Webb Space Telescope. I am also interested in habitability, both inside and outside the Solar System, and work on exo-habitability as a member of the NASA Nexus for Exoplanet System Science. 

In addition to my research, I enjoy popular science and scientific outreach through both speaking and writing in the media. I believe in supporting and inspiring young scientists.

Please use this site to learn more about me and my work. Head to the link at the top right where it says "POSTS".
