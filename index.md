# About Me

![](images/me_christmastree.jpeg)

Hi! I am Matthew, an astronomy graduate student at Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona.

I study exoplanets and their atmospheres through direct observations. Beyond research, I am involved with science outreach with the goal of supporting young scientists. You can use this site to learn more about me, my work, and the other cool things that I do. Head to the "Posts" link at the top right.

If you want to contact me, my email is mmmurphy@email.arizona.edu
