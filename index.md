# About Me

![](images/me_christmastree.jpeg)






Hi! I am Matthew, an astronomy graduate student at Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona.

If you want to **contact me**, my email is mmmurphy@arizona.edu

I study exoplanets and their atmospheres through a variety of observational techniques. I'm interested in the formation and composition of exoplanet atmospheres, and like to think about planetary habitability. Beyond research, I am involved with science outreach with the goal of supporting young scientists. You can use this site to learn more about me, my work, and the other cool things that I do. Head to the link at the top right.
